	Thanks for checking out TB conky. A simple top bar system monitoring conky. this is a pretty basic conky and is pretty much the same as my BG conky if you're 
familiar with that conky. I was just messing around and trying to make more room for more conky themes on my tiny screen display of 1366X768 screen. This so 
far has seemed to be a good step. 
	
	There are a few requirements for this conky to run.
   	 • Curl			sudo apt-get install curl
  	  • xrandr		sudo apt-get install xrandr
   	 • wmctrl		sudo apt-get install wmctrl
   	 
   Thats it for requirements on this one.
